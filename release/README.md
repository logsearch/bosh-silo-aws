Sometimes you want jobs to do things they weren't designed to do.

 * **testutils-data** - write (or overwrite) files
 * **testutils-idle** - a do-nothing template for a very boring server
 * **testutils-keys** - add custom, known keys to the `authorized_file` of `vcap`
 * **testutils-root** - give `vcap` password-less, sudo control
